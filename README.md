# Description

A tool to keep track of genes and their possible traits in the paradise station gentics lab. It automatically eliminates and does all kinds of magic to calculate the possibility of traits. 
It is most useful if you're doing "gonzo genetics" by pulsing radiation and injecting yourself to get the list of symptoms. 
You will, through the process of finding bad genes, be left with gaps of possible good genes to do block injections with. 

# Disclaimer
This is mainly a helper tool and in no way a tool to cheat the game. If you're experienced you can do these things in your head, or on paper.

# Workflow

Potassium Iodine or Penetic Acid is very useful to lower your humanoids radiation and your own. You will be injecting yourself with Structural Enzymes a lot.


1. Get a medbot from robotics.
2. Make 2-3 humanoids.
3. Add humanoid to pod.
4. Make Clean SE syringe.
5. Pulse Radiation on lowest setting until you have a couple of genes scrambled (how many is up to you)
6. Right click on the page and click "Select All" so that all the text is selected.
7. Copy the text by pressing Ctrl+C
8. Paste this into the Genetics Helper window. You should see the genes appear in the second column. 
9. Transfer to SE Buffer and create an injector.
10. Inject the humanoid with Clean SE from the buffer and drag them out so that the medbot can heal them.
11. Inject yourself with the injector you created
12. Inject yourself with Clean SE syringe immediately. (Annoying if you get tourettes and have to wait for it to end)
12. While you collapse from momentarely weakness, copy the list of symptoms from the chat (You don't have to be accurate in the copying because the program will simply search for the symptoms in the text you copied)
13. Paste the text into the Genetics Helper window. Your list of symptoms should show.
14. Click apply. The program will do its thing.
15. Goto 3 and use the next humanoid. Let the one you just used heal from the radiation.

You can confirm traits manually by clicking the "C" icon and using the - + buttons to choose the trait. 

tl;dr Blast your humanoids with radiation, scramble their genes, and inject yourself to see the effects. 
Repeat until you're happy with all the bad genes you've found, and some good genes too.
